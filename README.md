This project contains a Coq proof of the Friendship Theorem in graph
theory, following Proofs from THE BOOK, 4th ed., Aigner
et. al. pp. 257-259, 2010.

[This proof by Elizabeth
Walker](https://math.mit.edu/~apost/courses/18.204-2016/18.204_Elizabeth_Walker_final_paper.pdf)
is the same as the one in `Proofs from THE BOOK`. I followed it as
close as I could, but had to deviate a bit. E.g. MathComp doesn't
prove that symmetric matrices are diagonalizable over
algebraically closed fields. Instead I explicitly diagonalize the
$A^2$ matrix by constructing a basis change matrix. Then I prove
that whenever the characteristic polynomial of $A^2$ over `algC`
is $\prod_\mu (z-\mu)$, the characteristic polynomial of $A$ must
be $\prod_\mu (z\pm\sqrt{\mu})$.

The theorem formulation is currently
``` coq
(* 
	T is a finite nonempty set of people some of which are friends. 
	No one is friends with themselves (irreflexivity), and if x is 
	friends with y, then y is friends with x (symmetry). If every 
	pair of people have exactly one common friend, there exists one
	person that is friends with everyone else.
*)
Theorem Friendship
  (T: finType) (T_nonempty: [set: T] != set0)
  (F : rel T) (Fsym: symmetric F) (Firr: irreflexive F) :
  (forall (u v: T), u != v -> #|[set w | F u w & F v w]| == 1) ->
  {u : T | forall v : T, u != v -> F u v}.
```

The proof is mainly split up between
[theories/combinatorics.v](theories/combinatorics.v) for the graph
theory and [theories/adj2_matrix.v](theories/adj2_matrix.v) for
the linear algebra. The proof is roughly 2 parts combinatorics and
graph theory, 1 part linear algebra, and 3 parts more or less
general lemmas of matrices, characteristic polynomials and such.

As far as I know, this is the 79th [formalized Coq theorem](https://madiot.fr/coq100/) of the ["top 100" mathematical theorems](http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/) .
