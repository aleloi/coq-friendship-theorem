# Changelog

## Proof finished - 2022-08-??
### Added
- This changelog

### Changed
- Made a shorter formulation without the required total functions; added `statement_reduction.v`.
- Simplified `matrix_casts.v` after reading the castmx proofs in mathcomp.matrix. Turns out matrix casts are very simple in ssreflect.
- sigW in `combinatorics` instead of my much more complicated proof.
