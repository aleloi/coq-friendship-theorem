### Changed
- (2022-08-08): Added coqdoc, and meta.yaml following [coq-community/manifesto](https://github.com/coq-community/manifesto/wiki/Recommended-Project-Structure). There is currently no tagged release and no published `opam` package.
- Made a shorter formulation without the required total functions; added `statement_reduction.v`.
- Simplified `matrix_casts.v` after reading the castmx proofs in mathcomp.matrix. Turns out matrix casts are very simple in ssreflect.
- sigW in `combinatorics` instead of my much more complicated proof.
